# discord-zoom-moji
JavaScript program to make Discord emoji bigger.

To use this, just copy the content of the file and paste it into a bookmark and add "javascript: " in front of the text of the URL.

When you want to run it, just click the favorite/bookmark with Discord open in that tab.

NOTE: Currently ONLY works with custom emoji, as the regular SVG emoji spritesheets mess up when zoomed. Will try to figure it out, eventually.
